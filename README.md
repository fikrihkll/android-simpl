# Simpl App - New Way to Manage Your Money

You're really welcome if you want to contribute to this project.

This App is about to track the whole of your money and transactions. But at this time, you only can add your transaction manually whether it's from your wallet or your Bank Account. And you can also make a safe and then give progress to it.

But, you will get confused with the class/method name, because my English was bad at *Banking and Money Scope*. Even now, it's hard for me to know the flow of this Project, but It can be re-identified and refactor for it of course. Yeah, but I still don't have time to refactor this project and yeaa
